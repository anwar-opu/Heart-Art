# Heart Shape Drawing with Python Turtle

This project uses Python's Turtle graphics library to draw a heart shape. The script creates a red heart by combining forward movements and circles.

## How It Works

1. The script begins by setting the fill color to red using `begin_fill()` and `color("red")`.
2. It uses the Turtle's `forward` and `circle` methods to draw the left and right sides of the heart.
3. The shape is completed by moving the Turtle to connect the sides and filling the heart with red using `end_fill()`.

## Usage

1. Clone the repository and navigate to the project directory.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/anwar-opu/Heart-Art.git
cd Heart-Art
```
2. Run the script:
```bash
python main.py
```
3. A window will appear, displaying the red heart shape.
### Dependencies
